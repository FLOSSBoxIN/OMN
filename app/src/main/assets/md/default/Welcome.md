Summary: Open Markdown Note start page

This is simple, lightweight and open application to create and organize everyday notes.
Notes stored in Markdown format and shown as html. 

To see action buttons press on the page title.

This program use external editor. If you try to edit page and get message about no editor found install one, please.

Suitable almost any editor. 

I would recommend install any editor and file manager to use with this application.
For example:

##### Google Play Market:

* [OI Notepad](market://details?id=org.openintents.notepad)
* [X-plore File Manager](market://details?id=com.lonelycatgames.Xplore)

##### F-Droid:

* [OI Notepad](https://f-droid.org/app/org.openintents.notepad)
* [OI File Manager](https://f-droid.org/app/org.openintents.filemanager)

**Hint**: Before creating own start page press on <button onclick="Android.linkButtonCallback(PFN, Title)"><i class="material-icons">insert_link</i></button> button to save link to this page in clipboard. 


Read page about common [Markdown syntax](/default/Markdown.html) and then about
[Extended Markdown syntax](/default/MarkdownExt.html) specific for this application.

Any new pages can be created by editing current page and placing link to new page.

Create [Own start page](/Start.html)
