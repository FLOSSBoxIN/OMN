Summary: Open Markdown Note start page

### General information.

This is simple, lightweight and open source application to create and organize everyday notes.
Notes stored in [Markdown](Markdown.html) format and shown as html. New html page creates only if it does not exists or corresponding markdown page has later modification timestamp.

<span class="bg-yellow">To see action buttons press on the page title.</span>

This program use external editor. If you try to edit page and get message about no editor found install one, please.

Suitable almost any editor. 

I would recommend install the following editor and file manager to use with this application:

#### Recommended applications from F-Droid:

* [Simple generic text editor](https://f-droid.org/app/org.billthefarmer.editor)
* [OI File Manager](https://f-droid.org/app/org.openintents.filemanager)

#### Recommended applications from Google Play Market:

* [920 Text Editor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jecelyin.editor.v2)
* [OI Notepad](market://details?id=org.openintents.notepad)
* [X-plore File Manager](market://details?id=com.lonelycatgames.Xplore)

Read page about [using this application](Help.html)

Any new pages can be created by editing current page and placing link to new page. 
Another way to add new page is to press 'add new page' button on any page header. See help about it [here](Help.html#add-new-page).

Now, time to create [own start page](../Start.html). Which will be created with useful links inside automatically if it doesn't exists.

To quickly exit from the application quickly press "back" key twice.
