This is simple, lightweight and open source application to create and organize everyday notes.
Notes stored in [Markdown](Markdown.html) format and shown as html. New html page create if it does not exists or corresponding markdown page has later modification timestamp.

<span class="bg-yellow">To see action buttons press on the page title.</span>

This program use external editor. If you try to edit page and get message about no editor found install one, please.

Suitable almost any editor. 

I would recommend install the following editor and file manager to use with this application:

#### Recommended applications from F-Droid:

* [Simple generic text editor](https://f-droid.org/app/org.billthefarmer.editor)
* [OI File Manager](https://f-droid.org/app/org.openintents.filemanager)

#### Recommended applications from Google Play Market:

* [OI Notepad](market://details?id=org.openintents.notepad)
* [X-plore File Manager](market://details?id=com.lonelycatgames.Xplore)

Read page about [using this application](Help.html)

Any new pages can be created by editing current page and placing link to new page. 
[Another way](Help.html#-button-onclick-android-newpagebuttoncallback-i-class-material-icons-add_box-i-button-add-new-page-) is to press <button onclick="Android.newPageButtonCallback()"> <i class="material-icons">add_box</i> </button> at any page header.

Now, time to create [Own start page](../Start.html)
